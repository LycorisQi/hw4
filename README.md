1. How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?(I do not understand the second question.)
      38 lines are drawn each frame. Every 12 2/3 seconds.
      
      
2. What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?
      The first 10 defines the original x position.
      The second 10 defines how many the for loop will run for each time.
      The third 10 defines the distance between each line.
